# Wednesday Feb 7th
- I spent today deep diving back into leet code and problem solving. I want to split my attention into 50% leetcode and 50% project building. 

- Currently I'm still in planing on my bug tracker project and more so of my concern is configuring the UI. I'm trying to come up with a mock up and decide on my stack preference so that it is presentable for a user even though I mainly focus on the backend.

- I also spent some time studying vanilla Javascript for DOM manipulation. Working with node in the past and not having to worry about frontend work is vastly different. I practiced using Alpine.js to help manage state and make my web pages more dynamic and used HTMX for server communication in my last project just to prepare going forward. I plan on trying to dive more into the basics with frontend work but still prefer working on the backend. 

- I read into using hashmaps again and checked to see what is going on under the hood to better understand. For something like Python it is made easy for the user, practically we can just use dictionaries and treat it as a key value pair. Though if we go deeper we want to think about how our keys point to our values in memory. Python makes it more very hard to achieve but something to consider in general is the posibility of collisions.
